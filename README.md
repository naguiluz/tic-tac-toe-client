## Goals for My Users
- As a user I want to be greeted by a pleasing design and UI.
- As a user I want to be able to create and sign into my own account.
- As a user I want to be able to play multiple games of tic tac toe.
- As a user I want to be able to see which player won.
- As a user I want to be able to play on both small and large screens.
- As a user I want to be able to sign out of my account when I'm done playing.

## About the Current Working Version
<br> 
<p>This version of the game is the result of many hours of thoughtful consideration, intensive research, and collaboration with instructors and peers. It was an exercise in patience and tenacity, and it helped me realize that I can't expect to do everything on my own.</p> 

<p>With this project I set out to create an application that could be played by any number of users through personal logins and returned to later for more games. I learned many lessons while building this app. The first of which is planning. Below I have posted links to my rough schedule and wire frame sketches.</p>

<p>The app itself is built to create an account, accept a user sign in, and play any number of games back and forth on the same screen. There is no AI or online functionality as of yet. Games can be stopped at any time and reset to a fresh board. The application has the ability to declare a winner or a tie, and it does not allow a player to overwrite a taken space. Once a user is done, they are able to sign out of the app until they would like to play again.</p>

## Plans for Future Versions
<br>

There are many new features I would like to implement as my skills grow. The current goals I have in mind are as follows:
- Access to old, unfinished games that can be completed
- AI opponent with various difficulties
- User info page where scores, number of games played, etc. can be viewed
- Visual score counter for X and O
- Cleaner and more appealing design, layout, and UI
<br>

## Lessons Learned
<br>

- _**Planning is everything!!!**_ I intend on fleshing out my plans and writing out my thoughts much more often in the future.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help. I learned a lot from others and made strong connections with many of my peers.
- No need to start from scratch(_sometimes_). If something is giving you trouble, don't erase everything you've got right away. Look for a way to solve a problem with what you have. 
- Take pride in the progress you make. While I would've liked to have built this alone with no hiccups, stepping away and appreciating that I put something like this together after such a short time of studying will give me the determination to press on and try even harder on future projects.


##### PS... thank you so much to all of my instructors and classmates! Your insights and encouragement helped me get this done when I didn't think I could!
